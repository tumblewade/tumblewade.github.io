      <h2>Win Rates</h2>

        One question with my project is: Why would someone choose an opening with a lower win rate than another? Wouldn't they win more games 
        using the superior opening? First, I doubt everyone looks at the statistics to see the best openings. It could also be complexity, a lot 
        of these stats come from high level games, and as a beginner its hard to play some openings. Or maybe its enjoyment, some openings 
        could be more fun to play, and thats what chess comes down to: having fun. In an

          article by Yury Markushin on thechessworld</a>
        , he goes over win rates of several openings and their win/draw rates. I noticed from the openings, not all these openings are easy to play. So 
        that brings up another question: How much does ease to play contribute to win rates? In the lower rating groups, I hypothesize that simpler openings
        have the higher win rates, but in higher rating groups, the more complex openings do.
