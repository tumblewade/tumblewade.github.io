      <h4>Opening Move Statistics</h4>
      <p>In the graph below, you'll notice that the majority of games use a few first moves. This is simply because these moves give white the biggest lead. The other, less used, moves aren't used as much because they don't give as big of leads. This answers one of my question, which openings are most popular, to an extent. The most popular opening moves are e4, d4, Nf3, and c4. These are not, however, openings. They are just opening moves.</p>
