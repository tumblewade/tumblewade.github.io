      <h1> Chess Openings Visualizer </h1>

      <p> 
        Chess openings are the most important part of the game. They decide who starts with the superior position when the middlegame starts. 
        Some openings are better than others, some are easier to memorize. But in the end, their purposes are all the same. To give the player
        a better position coming out of it<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">. So the question becomes: which opening is the best? Could it be the Scicilian in all its positional 
        glory? Or is it the Ruy Lopez in its solid simpleness. Or maybe its my personal favorite, the Vienna. My project will explore the 
        numbers, which openings are most popular, and which ones have the highest win, draw, and loss rates.</span>

        One question with my project is: Why would someone choose an opening with a lower win rate than another? Wouldn't they win more games 
        using the superior opening? First, I doubt everyone looks at the statistics to see the best openings. It could also be complexity, a lot 
        of these stats come from high level games, and as a beginner its hard to play some openings. Or maybe its enjoyment, some openings 
        could be more fun to play, and thats what chess comes down to: having fun. In an

        , he goes over win rates of several openings and their win/draw rates. I noticed from the openings, not all these openings are easy to play. So 
        that brings up another question: How much does ease to play contribute to win rates? In the lower rating groups, I hypothesize that simpler openings
        have the higher win rates, but in higher rating groups, the more complex openings do.
