      <h1> Chess Openings Visualizer </h1>

      <p> 
        Chess openings are the most important part of the game. They decide who starts with the superior position when the middlegame starts. 
        Some openings are better than others, some are easier to memorize. But in the end, their purposes are all the same. To give the player

        glory? Or is it the Ruy Lopez in its solid simpleness. Or maybe its my personal favorite, the Vienna. My project will explore the 
        numbers, which openings are most popular, and which ones have the highest win, draw, and loss rates.</span>
